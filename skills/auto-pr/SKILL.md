name: auto-pr
description: Use when the user invokes `/auto-pr <repo-url>` or asks to "open N PRs against <repo>", "auto-contribute to <repo>", or "raise mergeable PRs automatically". Wraps the `vouch auto-pr` CLI: points at any github repo, learns its contribution norms (from shipped guidance, else synthesized from merged PRs), sources work items (open issues first, then agent-discovered improvements), and drives claude/codex to fix each one — alternating fixer and reviewer — opening a PR only when the repo's own test gate is green and the reviewing engine signs off.

# auto-pr

**Goal:** point at any github repo and open N *mergeable* PRs — not N PRs.
each one resolves a real issue (or a genuine discovered improvement), passes
the repo's own test gate locally, and is signed off by a second engine before
it ever reaches a maintainer.

this is a thin orchestration layer over the `vouch auto-pr` CLI. it is a
sibling tool to the knowledge base: it never writes to storage / proposals /
the audit log, and the review gate is untouched.

## invocation

```
vouch auto-pr <repo-url> \
  --workspace <dir> --count <N> \
  --claude-effort <low|medium|high|max> \
  --codex-effort  <low|medium|high|max> \
  [--issue-label good-first-issue] \
  [--fork-owner <login>] \
  [--max-revise 2] \
  [--dry-run] [--json]
```

`<repo-url>` may be `https://github.com/<owner>/<name>`,
`git@github.com:<owner>/<name>.git`, or the `<owner>/<name>` shorthand.

output: the URLs of the PRs that were actually opened (one per line, or a JSON
array under `--json`). attempts that fail verification are reported on stderr
as *skipped* with a reason — they are never opened. **M genuine PRs beats N
shaky ones**; partial success is the intended behaviour, not an error.

## prerequisites

- **`gh` CLI** authenticated for the target repo (`gh auth status` returns a
  session). used for fork/clone, issue listing, dedup search, and PR creation.
- **`claude`** (Claude Code) and **`codex`** on `PATH` — both engines are used;
  one fixes while the other reviews, alternating per PR.
- **`vouch` CLI** on `PATH` (`pip install vouch-kb`).

if `claude` or `codex` is missing, **stop and tell the user** — cross-verify is
the whole point; don't silently fall back to a single engine.

## how it works (the pipeline)

1. **resolve workspace** — if `--workspace` is already a clone, use it; else
   `gh repo fork --clone` (or a plain clone when you have push access). sync the
   default branch.
2. **detect-or-bootstrap guidance** — scan the repo for `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
   `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/skills/**/SKILL.md`, `.codex/`,
   `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. if any exist, they become fixer/reviewer
   context. **if none exist, fetch the repo's merged PRs and synthesize a
   contribution `SKILL.md`**, written into the clone's `.claude/skills/` (and a
   `.codex/` mirror) so it's reused next run.
3. **source N work items** — open *unassigned* issues first (filterable by
   `--issue-label`); if fewer than N survive dedup, let the engines discover
   genuine bugs/improvements to fill the remainder. every candidate is
   dedup-checked against the repo's existing PRs.
4. **per item** (isolated `auto-pr/<slug>` branch): the fixer engine edits +
   commits; the repo's own gate runs (`make check` / `pytest` / `npm test` /
   `cargo test` / `go test`); the *other* engine reviews the diff. a red gate or
   a rejection feeds back to the fixer for up to `--max-revise` rounds. still
   failing ⇒ skip with a reason. passing ⇒ push to the fork and `gh pr create`.

## house rules it enforces

- conventional-commit titles; lowercase prose bodies.
- **no `Co-Authored-By` / AI-attribution trailer** in generated commits.
- dedup before opening — no Nth duplicate of a tried/rejected fix.
- the repo's own CI-equivalent gate must be green locally before a PR opens.
- one logical change per PR; link/close the issue it addresses.

## effort levels

`--claude-effort` / `--codex-effort` tune each engine independently:

| level | claude model | codex reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| low | haiku | low |
| medium | sonnet | medium |
| high | opus | high |
| max | opus + extended thinking | high (codex cap) |

use `high` for real contributions; drop to `low`/`medium` only for cheap
exploratory runs. start with `--dry-run` against a new repo to see what it
*would* open before spending an engine on the real thing.

## failure semantics

- workspace resolution fails ⇒ the whole run aborts; nothing was opened.
- no work items ⇒ exit cleanly with "nothing to do".
- a single item fails (no diff, red gate, rejected past the cap, push/`gh`
  error) ⇒ that item is skipped with a reason; the batch continues.
- a missing engine binary ⇒ fail fast naming the binary.
